Average.java
- for this code I took continuous inputs from the user
  until they enter -1 as a flag to stop using a while loop.
  I added a possiblity where the user enters -1 right away, 
  the computer doesn't bother calculating anything and 
  ends immediately 

Minutes.java
- for this code I took days and weeks as two inputs from the
  user, convert weeks into days, the convert the total number 
  of days into hours, then minutes

Easter.java
- for this code I just copied the instructions from the 
  algorithm in the textbook, and added an input statement
  to take in a year from the user. I added two if statements 
  to help print out words for the output as Easter can only 
  occur in April or March
